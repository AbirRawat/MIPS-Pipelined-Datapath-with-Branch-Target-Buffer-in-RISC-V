/** 4-bit adder tester
  *
  * Truth tables are not very efficient for testing more complex components, as they grow
  * exponentially with the number of input bits. Therefore, we have to think of a more clever way to
  * test the 4-bit adder. To test the Basic Adder design in our Chisel Introduction, we used loops
  * to generate a sequence of increasing input values testing the design. To generate test cases for
  * the 4-bit adder, you should also start by using two nested loops. To determine the borders of
  * the loop counter, think about the lowest and the highest unsignes integer that you can represent
  * with four bit. To test the result produced by your design, think about what happens to the
  * result in case of an overflow and at which point this can happen. Hint: It might be helpful to
  * check the expected output behaviour for two different scenarios with the help of a condition.
